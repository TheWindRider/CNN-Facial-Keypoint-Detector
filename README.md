# Facial-Keypoint-Detector

### List of Content
- data: folder to keep training and testing data file to train neural network to recognize facial keypoints
- detector_architectures: folder to keep OpenCV pre-trained model to recognize faces and eyes
- AIND_Capstone.ipynb: python notebook with all code
- cnn_tuning.xlsx: many experiments to tune the global parameters of the neural network, which help finalize the best set of parameters used in the notebook

### Environment
Python 3.5 with Keras, which should be set to use Tensorflow as backend

Refer to notebook for all packages needed

### Data
Download data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data)

Unzip training and testing as two .csv file in data folder
